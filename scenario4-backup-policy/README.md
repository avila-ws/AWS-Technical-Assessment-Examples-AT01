# Scenario 4: Backup Policy Leveraging AWS Backup via Terraform Module

## 1. Objective

The requirement is to implement a comprehensive cloud backup policy on AWS using the **AWS Backup** service. Automation is crucial for deployment at scale. This will be achieved by creating a reusable **Terraform module** that encapsulates all the specified technical details and requirements.

The module itself does not need to be fully "production-ready" but must accurately reflect the required configuration and demonstrate knowledge of AWS Backup and Terraform best practices.
