# Scenario 1: AWS KMS Key Rotation Strategy

## 1. Overview and Context

This scenario addresses a simulated regulatory requirement mandating periodic key rotation for all applicable AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Customer Master Keys (CMKs). The current environment utilizes a centralized KMS setup within a dedicated security account and employs the Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) model, importing key material generated from an on-premise Hardware Security Module (HSM).

The primary goal is to define and implement a robust, secure, and minimally disruptive key rotation strategy that complies with this new requirement across different environments and services.

## 2. Relevant Current Architecture

The existing encryption implementation, illustrated in the provided assessment details, relies on the following key components and principles:

*   **Centralized KMS:** Keys are managed in AWS KMS within a dedicated AWS security account, isolating key management operations.
*   **BYOK Model:** Key material is generated externally on an on-premise HSM and securely imported into AWS KMS. This implies `Origin: EXTERNAL` for the KMS keys.
*   **Segregation:** Encryption is segregated by environment (e.g., Dev, Prod) and by service. Unique keys (or key aliases pointing to potentially unique keys) are used per service (identified in diagrams: S3, RDS, DynamoDB) within each environment.
*   **Key Aliases:** KMS key aliases (e.g., `alias/service-environment`) are used to reference keys, abstracting applications from specific key IDs. This is crucial for simplifying rotation.
*   **Least Privilege:** Key policies are implemented following the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions to users and services.

## 3. Question 1: Key Rotation Challenges and Impacts

Implementing mandatory rotation for existing BYOK KMS keys presents several challenges and potential impacts across technical, operational, and security dimensions:

### 3.1. Service-Specific Technical Challenges

AWS services interact with KMS keys differently, leading to varied rotation impacts:

*   **Amazon S3:**
    *   **Challenge:** Automatic KMS key rotation (via AWS) *does not* apply to existing S3 objects. When a key is rotated (new key material imported or alias updated), only *new* objects written to the bucket will be encrypted with the new key version. Existing objects remain encrypted with the previous key version.
    *   **Impact:** To achieve full compliance for data-at-rest over time, existing objects may require manual re-encryption (e.g., using S3 Batch Operations with a Lambda function or a COPY operation in place). This can be time-consuming and potentially costly for large buckets.
*   **Amazon RDS:**
    *   **Challenge:** Changing the KMS key associated with an encrypted RDS instance typically involves creating a new snapshot, copying the snapshot while specifying the *new* KMS key, and then restoring the instance from the encrypted copy or modifying the instance directly (depending on DB engine and specifics).
    *   **Impact:** This process often requires downtime for the database instance during the snapshot copy and restore/modification phase. The duration depends on database size and underlying operations. Careful planning and execution within maintenance windows are critical. Existing automated snapshots will also use the key version active at the time of their creation.
*   **Amazon DynamoDB:**
    *   **Challenge:** Tables encrypted with KMS (SSE-KMS) using a Customer Managed Key (CMK) handle key reference typically via alias. When the alias points to a new key/version, *newly written data* will use that new key. AWS manages the background encryption process. Similar to S3, DynamoDB *does not automatically re-encrypt all existing data* immediately upon alias change or key material rotation. Re-encryption happens over time as data is naturally rewritten or potentially through a full table export/import or backup/restore cycle if immediate compliance is mandated for all data.
    *   **Impact:** Potential performance implications during periods of heavy writes or explicit re-encryption activities. The primary impact is ensuring compliance timelines align with how DynamoDB handles key changes for existing data.

### 3.2. Operational Challenges

*   **Coordination:** Managing rotation across multiple environments (Dev, Int, Prod) and various service teams requires significant coordination and planning.
*   **Alias Management:** Strict discipline is needed to ensure applications *consistently* use key aliases instead of hardcoded Key IDs. Any direct Key ID usage will break upon rotation.
*   **BYOK Process Complexity:** The process of generating, securely transporting, and importing new key material from the on-premise HSM adds operational overhead compared to AWS-generated keys with automatic rotation.
*   **Testing and Validation:** Thorough testing is required in lower environments before applying changes in production to ensure applications function correctly with the rotated keys.
*   **Rollback Complexity:** Rolling back a key rotation, especially after new data has been written with the new key, can be complex and may require restoring from backups.
