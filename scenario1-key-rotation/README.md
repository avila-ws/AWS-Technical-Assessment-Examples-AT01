# Scenario 1: AWS KMS Key Rotation Strategy

## 1. Overview and Context

This scenario addresses a simulated regulatory requirement mandating periodic key rotation for all applicable AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Customer Master Keys (CMKs). The current environment utilizes a centralized KMS setup within a dedicated security account and employs the Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) model, importing key material generated from an on-premise Hardware Security Module (HSM).

The primary goal is to define and implement a robust, secure, and minimally disruptive key rotation strategy that complies with this new requirement across different environments and services.

## 2. Relevant Current Architecture

The existing encryption implementation, illustrated in the provided assessment details, relies on the following key components and principles:

*   **Centralized KMS:** Keys are managed in AWS KMS within a dedicated AWS security account, isolating key management operations.
*   **BYOK Model:** Key material is generated externally on an on-premise HSM and securely imported into AWS KMS. This implies `Origin: EXTERNAL` for the KMS keys.
*   **Segregation:** Encryption is segregated by environment (e.g., Dev, Prod) and by service. Unique keys (or key aliases pointing to potentially unique keys) are used per service (identified in diagrams: S3, RDS, DynamoDB) within each environment.
*   **Key Aliases:** KMS key aliases (e.g., `alias/service-environment`) are used to reference keys, abstracting applications from specific key IDs. This is crucial for simplifying rotation.
*   **Least Privilege:** Key policies are implemented following the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions to users and services.
