# Scenario 2: APIs-as-a-Product - Public and Private APIs Strategy

## 1. Overview and Context

This scenario evaluates the current architecture for building and deploying APIs on AWS, encompassing both internal (application-to-application) and public (customer, broker, etc.) usage patterns. The goal is to identify weaknesses in the existing setup and propose a revised architecture that securely and efficiently handles different API exposure levels, specifically addressing the need for private APIs and optimized internal traffic flow.
