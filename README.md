# AWS Cloud Engineering Assessment

Technical solutions for a cloud engineering assessment, exploring architecture challenges and implementation approaches.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: [Key Rotation Strategy](./scenario1-key-rotation/)
- **Scenario 2**: [API Architecture](./scenario2-api-management/)
- **Scenario 4**: [Backup Solution](./scenario4-backup-policy/)

## About This Project

This repository demonstrates my approach to solving cloud engineering challenges. Each folder contains detailed documentation with architecture diagrams and implementation code.

The solutions aim to address technical requirements while considering important factors like security, performance, and long-term maintainability.

Feel free to explore each scenario to understand the proposed implementations and technical reasoning behind them.

## Navigation

Each scenario folder contains its own README with detailed explanations of the proposed solution and implementation details.
